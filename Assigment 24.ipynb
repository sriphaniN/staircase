    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "    Keyword def that marks the start of the function header.\n",
    "    A function name to uniquely identify the function. \n",
    "    Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python\n",
    "    Lambdas are one-line methods without a name or we can say anonymous Func \n",
    "    They work practically the same as any other method in Python Lambdas differ from normal Python \n",
    "    methods because they can have only one expression,\n",
    "    can't contain any statements and their return type is a function object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "    Fewer Lines of Code Lambda functions are inline functions and \n",
    "    thus execute comparatively faster Many times lambda functions make code much more readable \n",
    "    by avoiding the logical jumps caused by function calls.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "   map applies as a transformation to an element. \n",
    "   The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and\n",
    "   executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them. Syntax : map(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "   filter accumulates only elements matching a condition. \n",
    "   filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a certain condition,\n",
    "   i.e. the function we passed returns True Syntax : filter(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "   reduce accumulates all elements to a single value,\n",
    "   by using immutable values reduce() works by calling the function we passed for the first two items in the sequence. \n",
    "   The result returned by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the next (third in this case)\n",
    "   ,element Syntax : reduce(function, sequence[, initial]).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "   Function annotation is the standard way to access the metadata with the arguments and the return value of the function.\n",
    "   These are nothing but some random and optional Python expressions that get allied to different parts of the function. \n",
    "   They get evaluated only during the compile-time and have no significance during the run-time of the code.\n",
    "   They do not have any significance or meaning associated with them until accessed by some third-party libraries. \n",
    "   They are used to type check the functions by declaring the type of the parameters and the return value for the functions. \n",
    "   The string-based annotations help us to improve the help messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax :\n",
    "         def func(a: 'int') -> 'int':\n",
    "             pass\n",
    "             \n",
    "       Annotations for simple parameters:\n",
    "        def func(x: 'float'=10.8, y: 'argument2'):\n",
    "\n",
    "      In the above code the argument, ‘x’ of the function func, has been annotated to float data type and the argument\n",
    "      ‘y’ has a string-based annotation. The argument can also be assigned to a default value using a ‘=’ symbol followed by \n",
    "       the default value. These default values are optional to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Annotations for return values:\n",
    "      def func(a: expression) -> 'int':\n",
    "      The annotations for the return value is written after the ‘->’ symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "    A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. \n",
    "    This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "   Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.\n",
    "   Use docstrings\n",
    "   Wrap linethat they don’t exceed 79 characters\n",
    "   Use of regular and updated comments are valuable to both the coders and users\n",
    "   Use of trailing commas : in case of tuple -> ('good',)\n",
    "   Use Python’s default UTF-8 or ASCII encodings and not any fancy encodings\n",
    "   Naming Conventions 8.Characters that should not be used for identifiers :\n",
    "   ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘O’ (uppercase letter oh), ‘I’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names \n",
    "   as these are similar to the numerals one and zero.\n",
    "   Don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers\n",
    "   Name your classes and functions consistently\n",
    "   While naming of function of methods always use self for the first argument.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "   Function can return single value\n",
    "   Can return multiple values, tuple\n",
    "   can return list,dictionary\n",
    "   can return function object\n",
    "   can return class object\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
