    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    " - understanding code become very easy.\n",
    " - we can call that function many times.\n",
    " - no need to write entire funtion, we can simply call that function name.\n",
    " - big problem can slove into small samples.\n",
    " -  can't much consume space and memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "  - function should have parentheses(()), \n",
    "  - a colon(:) , \n",
    "  - arguments with in the parentheses , \n",
    "  - properly indented , \n",
    "  - return or print expression statement in the end.\n",
    "  ex. def diff(x,y):\n",
    "          return x - y.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "    def function_name(variable1,varible2,...):\n",
    "        return(expression).\n",
    "               \n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "   we can create function but we need to call the function to execute it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "   there is only global and local scopes in the python program but we can write as many as  local scopes in our python program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "   the function exectues the local variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "   the return variable, gave some value back to the caller. yes it is possible to have a return value in an expression.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "   we can use print statement as well. but if the funtion doesn't have return statment the value become None.\n",
    "   \n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "   it is defined in main body of the function, \n",
    "   can be accessed throughout the program,\n",
    "   accessible to all functions in the program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "    NoneType.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "   - by using try and except clause.\n",
    "   \n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "    if we have a statement but we don't know whether it can execute without error or not we can use try clause,\n",
    "    if the code we written in the try clause leads to error , then we can use except clause to execute the function without any error.\n",
